    "# Hypothesis testing and the null distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the goals of this classwork is to reinforce the relationship between the null hypothesis, null distribution, p-values, and hypothesis tests. To review, the standard procedure of a hypothesis test is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) define your __Null Hypothesis__, or what you'd believe based on no evidence. This hypothesis is usually the \"lack of an effect\" which can look like $\\mathcal{H}_0: \\bar{X} = \\mu$. Your __alternative hypothesis__ is usually \"everything except the null hypothesis\", which looks like $\\mathcal{H}_A: \\bar{X} \\neq \\mu$. Other common alternatives are $\\mathcal{H}_A: \\bar{X} > \\mu$ or $\\mathcal{H}_A: \\bar{X} < \\mu$. Which one you choose effects what your __critical values__ are. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Based on the null hypothesis, you are looking for a __Test Statistic__, a random variable that captures your null hypothesis. For a null hypothesis of $\\mathcal{H}_0: \\bar{X} = \\mu$, the common test statistic that assumes an unknown variance is _t_ where $s_x$ is the sample variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ t = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{s_x/\\sqrt{n}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The distribution of your test statistic is called your __Null Distribution__. The distribution of the _t_ statistic  is the _t_-distribution, which we will look at a little bit more throughout this classwork. Notice that assuming the null hypothesis is true ($\\bar{X} = \\mu$) means that _t_ is equal to 0, and the mean of the _t_-distribution is 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) The purpose of the test is to determine how likely/unlikely it is to observe your sample in context of the assumptions stated above. In order to do so, we will find $\\bar{X}$ on the null distribution. The probability of $\\bar{X}$ occuring is the ___p_-value__. Whether or not you label something as significant is by comparing it to your __significance level__, $\\alpha$.\n",

    "The t-test is a largely robust method of comparing the mean to a value or the mean of another group. The method is generally robust for skewed distributions. Here we are going to compare the t-distribution to the normal distribution. Keeping in mind the CLT, what can we say about the point of diminishing returns with the $t$-distribution? Is there a cutoff point for degrees of freedom? (There is no simple answer here.)"

    "\n",
    "We are going to start from the CLT. \n",
    "We know that the sample means of a population are normally distributed, and therefore if we design our test-statistic with that in mind, we can some of the nice properties of the normal distribution. \n",

    "Similarly to the CLT, we know that the the sample deviation has a chi-squared distribution, $\\chi^2$. \n",
    "This fact leads to the t statistic being the normal distribution, divided by the chi-squared distribution, yielding the $t$-distribution."
